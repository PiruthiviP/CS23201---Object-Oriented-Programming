# CS3201 OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

Welcome to the repository for CS3201 OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING! This repository houses course materials, lab experiments.

## Objectives
- Learn the basics of C++ programming
- Understand Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Create and use classes and objects
- Explore inheritance and polymorphism
- Implement encapsulation and abstraction
- Master operator overloading and friend functions
- Use templates and exception handling
- Work with file I/O and streams
- Understand dynamic memory management and pointers



## Course Outcomes:
Upon completion of the course, the students will be able to
- Impart the skills needed for Object – oriented programming and Console applications
development.
- Map real-world objects into programming objects.
- Implement the concept of reusability and data security
- Write generic programs and handle exceptions
- Create and process data in files using file I/O functions
